# Tranzit-Richtofen-EE-Two-EMPs
Plutonium mod that edits the final step of the Richtofen Tranzit Easter Egg to only require two lamposts to be EMPed instead of four

Place the file in the ".\AppData\Local\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm\zm_transit" folder. Create any missing folders if necessary.

This mod is to make a solo playthrough of the Richtofen side Tranzit Easter Egg more realistic. It lowers the amount of lamposts that most be EMPed from four to two. Simply EMP a lampost, hop through its portal and EMP the lampost where you are teleported to complete the final step

Compiled with gsc-tool: https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool#gsc-tool using the command "gsc-tool comp t6 Tranzit-Richtofen-EE-Two-EMPs.gsc"
